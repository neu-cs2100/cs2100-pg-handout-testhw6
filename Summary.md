# SUMMARY


## Ethics

Many critical issues can arise when working with datasets that have real data that is based on data describing real people. That is, computer scientists need to consider the social impacts of their work at the beginning of their design process. We hope that these questions will provide a foundation for you to think critically about the social impacts of your work as you continue on into the wonderful field of computer science! Please take the time to seriously think about each of the questions presented below and answer each in at least 2-3 well thought-out sentences.

### Question 1
Plot a few "neutral" words such as "class", "the", and "teach". What do you see? Now plot a few more "loaded” words (thick normative terms) to investigate potential biases in the dataset. Possible examples: "funny", "rude", "professor", "teacher", "mean", "fair", "unfair", "genius", "brilliant". What do you see? Include at least three "loaded" words and their corresponding frequencies for men and women for the high, medium, and low groups in your answer.

### Question 2
Under what conditions (that could be observed from a dataset like this) would it be unfair for a university to use either the ratings or the prevalence of particular words (such as brilliant or genius) as a factor in decisions to hire, tenure, or fire professors? Assume the universities are using end-of-term student evaluations written by their own students, which might have different distributions.

### Question 3
What kind of information do the subjects represented in a dataset (in this case, professors) deserve to know about the trends in the data? How could you as the programmer provide this information?

### Question 4
Although the data we gave you has not been edited other than to remove punctuation, our visualization focuses on average scores and commonly used words. What kinds of interactions between students and teachers, both positive and negative, might be uncommon or not well represented by this dataset but important? For example, how might underrepresented students’ positive experiences of underrepresented teachers appear or not appear in this dataset?

### Question 5
In this assignment, we asked you, "does a professor's gender influence the language people use to describe them?" That is an important question, and we haven't given you the right kind of data to fully answer it: the dataset presents a binary classification of gender based on students’ beliefs as to the gender of the professor. There are some people in the dataset whose gender is misdescribed, and others, such as non-binary people, who do not have a category that fits them at all. If you could design the ratings website, how might you change or remove categories to address this problem?

### Question 6
Problem formulation is one of the ways in which your choices as a computer scientist embed values. Formulate a different problem related to the topics of professor evaluation or visualization of gendered patterns in language use, ideally one you could solve with your current skills. (A "problem" in this case refers to a scenario where a software program using this data would be useful. Examples include answering questions about professor evaluations or questions about gendered patterns in lagnauge use.) Explain why and for whom it would be good to solve that problem.

Once you've finished through thinking through and answering all these questions, make sure to stop and really admire the magnitude of what you've accomplished! You've wrangled a complex real-world dataset and used it to flex your ethical and critical thinking skills. Congrats on making it to the end!

## Logistics

### How many hours do you estimate the assignment took?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the averages of the range._

### Who did you work with and how?


### What other resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not just "Stack Overflow" or "Baeldung") and
state which ones were particularly helpful._

## Reflections

Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA who was especially
helpful, please share that._
